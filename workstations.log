The network fields indicate where a remote logon request originated. Workstation name is not always available and may be left blank in some cases.    The authentication information fields provide detailed information about this specific logon request.   - Logon GUID is a unique identifier that can be used to correlate this event with a KDC event.   - Transited services indicate which intermediate services have participated in this logon request.   - Package name indicates which sub-protocol was used among the NTLM protocols.   - Key length indicates the length of the generated session key. This will be 0 if no
